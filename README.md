# ds502-statistical-learning-of-wine-quality

In this project we applied various statistical learning methods to the famous [wine data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine), aiming to predict the wine Quality score using the physicochemical properties of wine.

Methods include:
- Multinomial logistic regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support vector machines (SVM)
- PCA

Code implementation for each method can be found in either .R or .Rmd files. The complete project story can be found in the .pdf file.
